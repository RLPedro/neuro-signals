# NeuroSignals

**NeuroSignals**  is an interactive real-time neural signal visualizer built with React, TypeScript, WebGL/Three.js, and custom signal-simulation logic.
It showcases engineering strengths across data streaming, UI architecture, 3D rendering, and complex state management.

This project was built as both a technical exploration into signal-processing simulations and a demonstration of front-end engineering capability: responsive UI systems, performant canvas rendering, modern React patterns, and clean component architecture.

## Features

### 🎛 Real-Time Streaming Architecture

- **Live simulated neural signals** displayed on a 2D canvas (oscilloscope)  
- **3D brain visualization** using Three.js / React Three Fiber (or similar) to render a brain model  
- **Recording**: Start and stop recording live session data  
- **Replay** previously recorded sessions  
- **Export** session data (e.g. JSON)  
- **Clear** the current session data  


### 🧠 WebGL 3D Brain Rendering

- Interactive 3D brain model 
- Custom scene + lighting in Three.js / React Three Fiber
- Dynamic markers for anomaly locations
- GPU-accelerated rendering integrated seamlessly into React


### 🛠 Tech Stack

- React + TypeScript + Vite + TailwindCSS
- Three.js / React Three Fiber (3D brain) + Canvas API (custom renderer for waveform display)
- Web Socket
